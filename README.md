# SQL-Murder-Mystery
I took on the challange of solving the SQL Murder Mystery @ https://mystery.knightlab.com/#experienced

This was a good chance to put my SQL skills to test since I have been in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Program. I am happy to say that I was able to complete both the normal challange and the advanced challange in about 45 minutes. If the system would handle the OR clause I think I could have gotten it much quicker. 

It was a lot of fun to give this a try and I will be trying the other games that are out there soon. It is rewarding to know that the skills I am gaining are just that, skills.
